hey!  

this works only with gmail api from google cloud console 

open this folder that contains these files create a python virtual environment and activate it 

install the dependencies you know which when you run the .py file

and then fill the credentials file with the actual credentials from your gmail api or download them in json form \

get your certificates into the certificates folder and your xcel file et VOILA !

thank you!
